# TheCodeChroniclesü¶Å
A fun repository for code creativity, machine learning, AI, and various projects! This is where I document my coding journey, focusing on ML, AI, data structures in Python, and exciting projects.

## üìå About
Welcome to **TheCodeChronicles**! This repository is all about exploring and experimenting with code in a way that's engaging and fun. While daily logging is ambitious, the goal is to consistently contribute and share exciting projects related to ML, AI, and Python.

## üî• Contributions
1. **Simple Neural Network Without Machine Learning Libraries**
  - Implemented a basic neural network from scratch using only Python's built-in modules.
2. **SHAP Explanation for XGBoost on California Housing Data**
  - SHAP visualizations for XGBoost on the California Housing dataset reveal how features like MedInc, Latitude, and Longitude influence house price predictions.
3. **Gap Statistic Method for Finding Optimal Clusters**
  - A statistical approach to determine the optimal number of clusters by comparing actual clustering performance with a random baseline.

More projects coming soon! Stay tuned. üöÄ
