# Regression Analysis with Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates various regression techniques using Scikit-Learn and other relevant Python libraries. The focus is on implementing and visualizing different regression models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, Ridge and Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, and techniques for handling multicollinearity, standardization, cross-validation, and outlier detection.

## Usage

The main content of this project is contained within the Jupyter Notebook `regression.ipynb`. To view and interact with the notebook:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kavinrog/TheCodeChronicles/RegressionCodes.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd RegressionCodes
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `regression.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface to explore the code and visualizations.

## Features

- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Implemented using Scikit-Learn's `LinearRegression` to model relationships between multiple features and a target variable.

- **Gradient Descent for Linear Regression**: Custom implementation of gradient descent to optimize linear regression parameters.

- **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Comparison of Ridge and Lasso regression techniques to handle multicollinearity and feature selection.

- **Polynomial Regression**: Demonstrated how to fit a polynomial regression model to capture non-linear relationships.

- **Multicollinearity Check**: Utilized Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity among features.

- **Feature Standardization**: Applied standardization to features before regression to ensure model stability.

- **Cross-Validation**: Implemented cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the regression model.

- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Used z-scores to identify and remove outliers from the dataset before applying regression.
